# No_show_appointments
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it.
we use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

This dataset collects information
from 100k medical appointments in
Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.
